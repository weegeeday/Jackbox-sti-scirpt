This script automaticly mods the Survive The Internet images. <br />
It does not mod the tumbnails as of the last time i updated this readme. <br />

# How do i use this?
Simple! <br />
1.Make sure you have python is installed, and its on your [PATH](https://datatofish.com/add-python-to-windows-path/ "Adding Python to PATH"). <br />
2.Run Setup.bat OR in cmd, run this: pip install Pillow <br />
3.Put the images you want the program to randomly replace in Replacement Images. <br />
4.Make sure you backup all of these replacement images in the backup folder, or your own. <br />
5.Double Click Main.py OR run it in cmd (makes reading the console easier.) <br />

# Crashed? and other stuff.
Whenever there are no more replacement images, it just crashes! <br />
It is completly normal. <br />
If it crashes when there are still images in that folder, leave a [github issue](https://github.com/weegeeday/Jackbox-sti-script/issues/new/choose). <br />
If you have any requests, suggestions or features youd want, make a [github issue](https://github.com/weegeeday/Jackbox-sti-script/issues/new/choose) about it! <br />
